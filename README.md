# Jozephus-Problem

The Josephus Problem is a classic puzzle that involves a group of people standing in a circle where every nth person is executed, and the circle shrinks until only one person is left standing. This repository contains a Python implementation of the Josephus Problem, showcasing various approaches to solve this problem, including iterative, recursive, and mathematical solutions. This project serves as a practical example for understanding algorithms and data structures, particularly recursion and circular linked lists.
